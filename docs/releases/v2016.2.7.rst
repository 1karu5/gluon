Gluon 2016.2.7
==============

This release only fixes a single regression introduced in Gluon v2016.1.6.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Improve sysupgrade error handling (`#1160 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1160>`_)

  If for some reason processes don't react to SIGKILL (usually because of a kernel bug),
  a node could hang forever in sysupgrade, requiring a power cycle. This has been
  fixed, triggering a reboot instead.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promicious mode is disallowed).

* Inconsistent respondd API (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)

  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API will still be supported for a while.
